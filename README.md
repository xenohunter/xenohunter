I've been programming for 11+ years, mostly in Python and TypeScript. Iâ€™m pretty knowledgeable about IT in general and have developed deep expertise in several areas. In the last 5 years I have worked with several teams building complex applications. I swiftly absorb new knowledge and do a lot of maths. I publish a [newsletter](https://unstableorbits.substack.com/), know how to juggle 3 balls, and play the piano. I also read a lot, both technical literature and fiction, and keep track of all those books on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46199633-phil-filippak).
