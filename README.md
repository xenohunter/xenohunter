I worked as a frontend and full-stack developer for 7 years and then as a machine learning engineer and team lead during the last 4 years. Now I'm getting back to frontend development because that's what excites me the most.

Some of my achievements that have the highest frontend relevance:
- developed a [Chrome extension](https://github.com/xenohunter/bluesky-overhaul) improving the UX on Bluesky web app
- launched [one of the first](https://waves.exchange/) client-side crypto wallet apps
- managed a cross-functional team of 6 people working on that app
- authored a client-side [cryptographic API library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/waves-api?activeTab=code)
- created two small browser games for the js13kGames contest (here's [one](https://js13kgames.com/entries/glitch-rabbit) and believe me, you don't want to see the other one)

Among my hobbies:
- publishing a Substack [newsletter](https://unstableorbits.substack.com/) (very irregularly)
- reading long rational fiction novels (you can check what I've read on my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46199633-phil-filippak) account)
- juggling (only three balls so far but with a variety of patterns)

I would love to work on meaningful projects together with people who genuinely want to change the world for the better.
